Buck sighs.The rest of the team, who are gearing up.Dutch examines a silenced M7 SMG.Romeo grabs an M90 Shotgun and offers it to Dutch.Dutch shoves the shotgun away, glancing over Romeo's shoulder. Romeo turns to see Dare and Buck walk into the scene.Buck overhears and approaches Romeo.Buck takes the shotgun from Romeo's hands, puts it back onto the rack, and angrily shoves a sniper rifle into his hands instead.Cut to the Rookie, still asleep next to his pod. Romeo walks to him and hits him with his sniper rifle's butt.Cut to the Rookie's point of view as he wakes up.Dutch pushes Romeo away.Dutch: "Relax, Rookie, he don't mean nothin'. Besides, now's one of those times it pays to be the strong, silent type."Dutch hands an M7S SMG to the Rookie, who attaches it to his pod's weapon rack and positions himself on the seat. The pod's hatch closes, and the platform from which all the pods are hanging descends into the launch bay.Once the hatch closes, the player is free to look around.Buck and Dare appear on the pod's viewscreens.The pod's screens flicker with static as the platform comes to a stop.The pods drop away from the ship, punctuated by a countdown sound before the Rookie's pod detaches. His pod exits the launch bay to an expansive view of low Earth orbit. The tether of the New Mombasa Orbital Elevator can be seen in the background surrounded by multiple destroyed UNSC ships. Operational vessels prowl amongst the wreckage. A thick cloud cover below the pods stretches to the horizon.The pods pass close to several destroyed Charon-class light frigates during their descent.The pods reach the cloud layer.The screen flashes white as the Rookie's pod falls through the cloud layer. The city of New Mombasa and the Assault Carrier above it come into view.The squad's pods veer off to a new course.A stream of energy flickers across the carrier's hull.A slipspace rupture opens before the carrier and rapidly expands, creating a crater on the ground below it.The UNSC In Amber Clad can be seen moving towards the carrier.Dare is cut off as the carrier disappears into the rupture, taking In Amber Clad with it and releasing a massive explosion and shockwave.Mickey's pod slams into the Rookie's, cracking the window. Inside the pod, all screens turn red with warnings before the EMP fries the pod's systems. The Rookie grabs onto a handhold as his pod plummets into freefall without a chute to slow it.

The screens that are still working are filled with static. Two Covenant Phantoms fly in the background.Shortly after the dropships pass, the Rookie activates four explosive bolts to release his pod door open.

The screen adjusts to the brightness, and the air is still full of blue particles from the rupture. From a camera below the Superintendent watches two SOEIVs drop in, one of them bounces off a building, deflects into a second and crashes upside down, the other pod goes straight behind the second building. The Superintendent zooms in on the first pod, its avatar showing a sad face.Buck's hatch opens and he falls out of his pod.Buck tries to take out his Assault Rifle, but it is stuck.He finally gets his Assault Rifle out.A Phantom flies overhead. Buck looks up.Buck cocks his Assault Rifle.After fighting through a group of Covenant, Buck comes across two Marines behind a destroyed Warthog.In the building on the second floor, Buck finds various Elites and Brutes dead.After battling through more Covenant forces, Buck comes across more Elite and Brute corpses.Buck comes across a Deployable lookout tower with some various Jackals and Grunts around it.After opening the door Buck finds a group of Marines armed with Silenced SMGs around a destroyed Warthog, taking fire from Covenant on higher ground, soon getting killed.A pair of Hunters emerges from the set of doors on the other side of the area.
After clearing the area of Covenant and proceeding through another door, Buck arrives at Dare's location.
Dare's SOEIV comes into view, under attack by three Grunts After dispatching the Grunts he approaches her pod and tries to open the door.Buck manages to shove the hatch off the pod, but it is empty. Suddenly, an Engineer pops out at Buck.The Engineer gets closer to Buck, who falls over backwards, and a blue light appears from its helmet.Buck sees Dare's damaged helmet in one of its tentacles.A sniper rifle goes off, killing the Engineer. Romeo is revealed to have taken the shot. Romeo waves to Buck, who returns it.Buck gets up, the Engineer starts to shake and starts to give off a high pitched whine, Buck dives for cover and it explodes, propelling Dare's helmet into the air. The Superintendent tracks the helmet.The Superintendent finds that the helmet will be launched through a window.The Superintendent's avatar shows a happy face.Romeo doesn't respond. Buck takes his helmet off.Buck: "Hey, Romeo! You got your ears on?" Romeo shrugs.Buck: "Oh, I get it. Permission to speak, smart ass."Romeo: "No, I don't know what it was, but it was gonna grease your ass good. Just like it did the Captain."Buck: "Yeah. Maybe. You hear from Mickey? Dutch?"Buck investigates a piece of the Huragok's armor, with Dare's stomach armor plate attached to it, stuck in a wall.Romeo: "Negative."Buck: "The Rookie?"Romeo shakes his head.Buck: "We need to get above this crap, link up with the bee-net. One of our drones must have seen where they hit."Romeo: "So, we're poppin' smoke on the lady's mission? She ever tell you what she wanted?"
Buck: "No... never. Doesn't matter. All I care about now is gettin' my men out of this city. Even you."
Buck puts his helmet back on.Fade to black end of flash back.</p>

The Huragok gives out a high-pitched wail.The Brute Minors release the Huragok.The Rookie crouches down to the Optics Package. Some sparks fly out of it, and the camera twitches.

The ODST is Dutch who watches the Fighters fly overhead. Dutch heads up a hill to a clearing where Marines are engaging Covenant armor and infantry, a group of Marines are taking cover near an overturned Warthog, one of the Marines spots him.Together they take out the enemy infantry.They engage heavy Covenant armor, including Wraiths, Choppers and Ghosts.After defeating the first Wraith, another moves up and a Phantom arrives dropping off reinforcements; those are soon defeated as well.The Marines move to another section of the park where they encounter Shades, Choppers, Banshees and more infantry, the Marines head up the hill taking out the Covenant defenses.A Brute tries to escape on a Ghost.Dutch arrives at second platoon's location. They are under heavy fire from more Covenant armor and infantry.If Dutch takes too long As Dutch and the Marines cross the bridge, the Space Elevator, already weakened from the Slipspace rupture, implodes in different sections and collapses, sending debris flying for miles.A part of the elevator crashes into the building Dutch and the Marines are driving to.Dutch soon arrives at the Assault Carrier's old LZ, where a group of Marines are pinned down by more Covenant troops.Dutch finally reaches the top of the hill, and is faced by one final Wraith, a War Chieftain and many Covenant forces.War Chieftain: "Let no humans escape, to say what they have seen!"
Marine #2: "Find a hole in the wall, trooper! Drive right through it!"Marine #2: "Trooper, there's a hole! Floor it!"Marine #2: "Make the jump, now!"Dutch drives off the cliff, into the streets below.Dutch's Warthog flies off the cliff and lands on the streets below, bouncing once, then crashes into a building. Dutch falls out after the bounce, and his helmet falls off.Dutch: "Uh, Lord? I didn't train to be a pilot. Tell me I don't have any more flying to do today."The view switches to a Superintendent camera that is watching as a Drone Fighter crashes into a monument. The Superintendent's avatar shows the "sad face" image. The optics detaches from the fighter and crashes to the ground, where the Rookie later finds it. Dutch gets up, helmet in one hand.Dutch: "So...was that a yes or a no?"The vehicle Dutch was driving previously explodes behind him. He turns around to face it.

3 HOURS AFTER DROP

The flashback begins with a door in the NMPD Headquarters opening. Buck immediately takes point while Romeo watches his back.View changes to one of the Superintendent's cameras as he watches Buck and Romeo exit to the outside landing pad.Buck stops and turns to Romeo.Buck shakes his head at Romeo as he walks past.Mickey's and Dutch's NMPD variant Pelican Dropship comes in for a landing as Buck flags them down.Just as the Pelican Dropship prepares to land, two Banshee fighters come into view and open fire on the Pelican.Buck and Romeo drop to the floor and cover their heads while the Pelican takes a hit from a Banshee's Fuel Rod Cannon.The Pelican spins out of view as Buck and Romeo fire at the attacking Banshee fighters.Romeo looks around for any other enemy aircraft while Buck activates his comm.Buck de-polarizes his visor, and puts his hands on Romeo's shoulders.Romeo and pulls the charge handle on his Assault Rifle.The two go back indoors.Romeo and Buck sneak outside to the first courtyard.Romeo fires.After a moment of fighting, a Phantom flies overhead.After another moment of fighting,Romeo and Buck fight their way to the second courtyard.After another firefight, the two make their way inside again.Inside the next room, there is spare ammo and Med-Packs laying around, as well as several dead NMPD officers.Romeo grabs some more ammo and heals up if needed, then rejoins Buck outside in the third courtyard.After the first shot is taken,After the two make their way further into the courtyard,After the firefight,The two make their way into the fourth courtyard and dispatch all of the Covenant forces and get back indoors.Romeo and Buck fight their way to a landing pad, Mickey's and Dutch's Pelican can be seen on the rooftop of a nearby skyscraper. There is a bundle of long girders being held up by a crane that appears to be the only way across.Romeo progresses over the make-shift bridge, two Banshee fighters fly low overhead and shake the bridge.Buck and Romeo get off of the make-shift bridge and rejoin Mickey, Dutch and a couple of NMPD Officers on a rooftop littered with various heavy weapons.The squad fights a few waves of enemy aircraft consisting of Banshee fighters and Phantom dropships. One Phantom drops off infantry.After the enemy infantry is dispatched and a couple more waves of enemy aircraft are fought off,More waves of Banshees and Phantoms are fought off.More waves are fought off.The final waves of enemy aircraft are fought off. Only one Phantom Dropship remains.The Phantom dropship swoops down and drops a Hammer wielding Brute Chieftain.Buck: "Scatter!"The chieftain kills an NMPD officer with his hammer and Romeo fires at the chieftain with his Sniper Rifle, collapsing its shield. A shockwave from the hammer sends the sniper back into a barrier and the chieftain, using its hammer's bladed end, brings it down on Romeo's chest. Romeo attempts to shield himself using the sniper rifle, but the blade easily bends it and penetrates Romeo's armor and chest. Romeo cries in pain and starts gasping for breath. The sniper rifle (Mission Beacon) gets caught on the chieftain's hammer and it throws it off, sending the mangled weapon to the streets below.Giving out a victorious roar, the chieftain prepares to finish Romeo, but Buck jumps on its back and stabs it in the throat with his Combat Knife. As the chieftain chokes and gurgles, while stumbling around the landing pad, Mickey tries to get a clean shot on it with his shotgun but is unable to. Thus, he tackles the chieftain to the ground, manages to knock off the chieftain's helmet/headdress and Dutch shoulder-charges it, finishing the Brute.Dutch cocks his fists as if boxing while Mickey gets back up. Buck, who is still under the dead Chieftain, waves his hand out.Buck (Muffled): "Get. This. Thing. Off. Of. Me."Dutch and Mickey exchange looks and help Buck with the dead Brute. Buck takes his combat knife out of the Brute's neck, shakes some blood off, which hits Dutch, and cleans it off on his arm. Romeo begins to cough and wheeze and Mickey immediately tends to him.Buck: "How bad?"Romeo de-polarizes his visor and takes his hand off the wound.Romeo: "Ahh, not good." Mickey: "We're gonna get you outta here."
Dutch gestures towards the crashed Pelican.Dutch: "Not by air, we're not."
Buck: "It's alright."Buck helps Romeo up and uses himself as support for him.Romeo: "Ahh!"Buck: "I know another way."Switches to the Superintendent's camera, who is watching the ODSTs help their injured squadmate.End of flash back fades back to the Rookie.
