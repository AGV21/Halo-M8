                <p>Noble Team is sent to Visegrad, a remote region on Reach. The down relay is Reach's only communication to the rest of the UNSC. The down relay is suspected of foul play by local insurrectionist. 
                   As they are walking, they come across the dead bodies of the UNSC troops that were originally sent to fix the relay. They no longer suspect the insurrectionists based on the damage of the dead bodies. 
                   They then get ambused by a Covenant force. They fight until they which the relay. Noble Team brings the relay back up and contacts their corresponding higher-up: Colonel Holland, Declaring Winter Contingency.</p>
